This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

You can read the guid for it [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md), which lists some of the basic commands available, including: `npm start`, `npm test`, and `npm build`.

Clone the repo, run `npm i` to install any dependencies, and then hit `npm start` to see this in the browser.
